           <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
           <p>As someone who works in traditional art,  I am fascinated by how technology can be used to create unique and immersive experiences that blur the lines between the real and the virtual that is done in digital media. My work explores the intersections of art and technology, as I seek to explore the boundaries of what is possible within this medium. 

At the heart of my practice is a deep fascination with the possibilities of digital media and the ways in which it can be used to create art that is not only visually stunning but also intellectually stimulating. Through my work, I seek to explore the complex relationships between humans and technology and to spark conversations about the impact of technology on our lives, both positive and negative.

Through my art, I wish to tell stories that interact with the audience. By experimenting with various forms of digital media, including video, sound, and animation, I strive to create works that are not only visually stunning but also intellectually stimulating.

In terms of technique, I am always pushing the boundaries of what is possible with digital media. Whether through the use of cutting-edge software or custom-built hardware, I am constantly experimenting with new tools and techniques in order to create works that are both visually stunning and technically sophisticated.

Ultimately, my goal as a digital media artist is to create works that inspire wonder, curiosity, and reflection. That challenges viewers to see the world around them in new and exciting ways. Through interactive digital experiences, I want to create art that connects with people on a deep and meaningful level, encouraging them to explore the possibilities of this rapidly-evolving medium.

Career-wise, I want to continue to explore and expand my abilities with art and technology while also doing collaborations to make bigger projects. With my ability to tell a story through art, I wish to continue my artist journey in a gaming company.
